              <strong>SmartQb (Smart Query Builder)</strong> lets you ask questions in plain English about your finance and CRM data.
              It generates clear, executive-ready reports and delivers them by email — ad-hoc or on a schedule.

              Yes, that's the whole point, the app is very simple (2 pages). We know most people don't understand SQL or code, so
              we let you ask questions in your natural language and AI does an amazing job of working out the rest.

              Yes. You can schedule reports to arrive in your inbox <strong>daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly</strong>.

              Reports are delivered by email in a clean format with summaries and supporting detail. Depending on your
              query, reports can include a CSV attachment where you can build complex Pivot Tables etc in Excel. AI is usually
              smart enough to determine whether you want a CSV or HTML summary sent to your email.

              SmartQb connects to your systems using their official authentication methods (OAuth2).

              Our system and data are hosted/stored in Microsoft Azure in South Eastern Australia. 
              Microsoft Azure is very secure, 
              leveraging a defense-in-depth strategy with physical datacenter security, 
              strong encryption (at rest and in transit), network segmentation, 
              and built-in security features like Azure Firewall and Azure Key Vault

              SmartQb connects to your systems when queries run to fetch the latest data. It talks to your systems
              via their published APIs. The data retrieved is then stored in our secure Microsoft Azure Storage where
              it is queried on demand. The data is available only to your queries, it is not used for any other purpose.

              No. We use AI to build the query Approach. Once you're happy with the approach and save the Query, AI is again used
              to build runtime code to run against your data. It NEVER looks at your data, nor should it.

              Yes. But you won't be able to generate new queries until OpenAI is back up and running. This is very rare and unlikely
              to be an extended outage.

              This can depend on the size of your business data within the connected system. We initially extract 2 years past worth 
              of data from your system, this is usually adequate for queries you want to run today. If for example, you have half a million 
              invoices, our system might take a few minutes to fetch these, then the query is executed against the data and the email sent. This
              may take up to 5-10 minutes.

              Once we have the 2 years of data, we only fetch changes from your system so emails are usually snappy and received in your inbox
              within a minute or two.

              No. SmartQb is designed for natural-language questions — no SQL, no spreadsheets, no dashboard-building.
              Ask → receive a report → schedule it if it’s useful.
